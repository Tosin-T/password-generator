# Password Generator
This is a project where the aim was to create a code using javascript to build a responsive, customisable password based on he user response. I found this project to be really interesting and challenging in the right ways. A breakthrough moment for myself was finding out that the concat function in javascript produced unwated comma characters when i was trying to call the array. Using the join function instead really helped to progress the projects development
